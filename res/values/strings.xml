	<string name="strOppsLabel"><b>What is "Strike opportunities"?</b></string>
	
	<string name="strOppsHelp">"Strike opportunities" is the number of chances you had to roll a strike. This value depends on last frame and varies from 10 to 12.\n\n
	For example, you have 9 strikes in first 9 frames, and 10th is open frame. Even though it is open frame, it counts as strike opportunity. So you got <b>10</b> in total.\n\n
	If you made 10 strikes in a row, and got open frame or spare after that (or 9 strikes, spare and another strike) - it counts as <b>11</b> opportunities.\n\n
	And with 11 or 12 strikes in a row it is always <b>12</b> strike opportunities. \n
	\n
	<b>To make it simple:</b>\n
	0 strikes in last frame - 10 opps\n
	1 strike in last frame - 11 opps\n
	2 or 3 strikes in last frame - 12 opps\n</string>
	
	<string name="whyLabel"><b>Why so complicated?</b></string>
	
	<string name="whyDesc">We don\'t want to input results for every frame, but we want an accurate statistics.\n
	Unfortunately, bowling got this annoying last frame, which mess everything up, so we need to track what is going on there.\n 
	That\'s why we use "Strike opportunities".\n</string>
	
	<string name="perfectGameLabel"><b>Perfect game chance</b></string>
	
	<string name="perfectGameLabelDesc">I didn\'t included "Perfect game chance" into statistics because numbers like 0.000000000001% makes me sad. And they mess up small screens too.\n
	So I\'ll just leave it here:\n
	90% strikes: (0.9)^12 = 28%\n
	80% strikes: (0.8)^12 = 6.8%\n
	70% strikes: (0.7)^12 = 1%\n
	60% strikes: (0.6)^12 = 0.2%\n
	50% strikes: (0.5)^12 = 0.02%\n
	40% strikes: (0.4)^12 = 0.0016%\n
	30% strikes: (0.3)^12 = 0.000053%\n
	20% strikes: (0.2)^12 = 0.00000004%\n
	10% strikes: (0.1)^12 = 0.000000000001%\n
